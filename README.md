# Music Bot
Music Bot is a site/discord bot set up to provide soundtrack-like support for discord servers.
Information about the tools and even how to run your own bot can be found below.

## MusicBot
To Run the music bot, you can run the docker image deployed to this repository with the following command:
```shell
docker run --rm -d --name music-bot -e BOT_TOKEN=<YOUR BOT'S TOKEN> ghcr.io/ddellspe/music-bot 
```
This Music bot provides you self-hosted capabilities similar to what Groovy and Rythm did (before YouTube shut them down).
This project will slowly build items over time and accept pull request to update the code or add new features.
